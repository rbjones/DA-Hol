The Decentralised Autonomous HOL project
======================================

This project seeks to place interactive and automated proof, in diverse languages interpreted in Higher Order Logic, in its proper very broad context, around which an all-enveloping deductive ecosystem is envisaged.

The very first stage of this project, prior to inviting collaborators, is the writing in the project wiki of a "manifesto", sketching the nature of the proposed enterprise.
